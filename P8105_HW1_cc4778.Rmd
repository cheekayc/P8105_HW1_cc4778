# Problem 1

This is a preview of the `penguins` dataset.
```{r load penguin, echo = FALSE}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
head(penguins, 10)
```

#### A short description of the `penguins` dataset

The `penguins` dataset consists of `r ncol(penguins)` variables and `r nrow(penguins)` observations.

The variables name and their corresponding types are listed as below:

1. `species` : Factor with 3 levels 
   * Adelie
   * Chinstrap
   * Gentoo
  
2. `island` : Factor with 3 levels
   * Biscoe
   * Dream
   * Torgersen
  
3. `bill_length_mm` : numeric values

4. `bill_depth_mm` : numeric values

5. `flipper_length_mm` : integers

```{r mean flipper length, echo = FALSE}
mean_flip = mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```
    * The mean flipper length (in mm) of the sampled penguin population is `r round(mean_flip, digits = 2)`.

6. `body_mass_g` : integers

7. `sex` : Factor with 2 levels
    * Female
    * Male
  
8. `Year` : Integers


#### Scatterplot

This is a scatterplot of flipper length versus bill length by the three groups of species.

```{r scatterplot, warning =  FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```
```{r save graph, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggsave("Scatterplot.pdf", height = 6, width = 10)
```


# Problem 2

#### Creating a data frame

```{r data frame}
df = tibble(
  time_min = rnorm(10),
  on_time = time_min > 0,
  zone = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "A", "B", "C", "D", "E"),
  color = factor(c("Green","Red","Yellow","Yellow","Yellow","Red","Green","Red","Yellow","Green"))
)
head(df, 10)
```
