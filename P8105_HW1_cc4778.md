#### A short description of the `penguins` dataset

The `penguins` dataset consists of 8 variables and 344 observations.

The variables name and their corresponding types are listed as below:

1.  `species` : Factor vector with 3 levels

    -   Adelie
    -   Chinstrap
    -   Gentoo

2.  `island` : Factor vector with 3 levels

    -   Biscoe
    -   Dream
    -   Torgersen

3.  `bill_length_mm` : Double, numeric vector

4.  `bill_depth_mm` : Double, numeric vector

5.  `flipper_length_mm` : Integers, numeric vector

    -   The mean flipper length (in mm) of the sampled penguin
        population is 200.92.

6.  `body_mass_g` : Integers, numeric vector

7.  `sex` : Factor vector with 2 levels

    -   Female
    -   Male

8.  `Year` : Integers, numeric vector

#### Scatterplot

This is a scatterplot of flipper length versus bill length by the three
groups of species.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```

I am exporting an image of this scatterplot as a pdf file and save it in
my Rproject folder.

``` r
ggsave("Scatterplot.pdf", height = 6, width = 10)
```

# Problem 2

#### Creating a data frame

``` r
df = tibble(
  time_min = rnorm(10),
  on_time = time_min > 0,
  zone = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "A", "B", "C", "D", "E"),
  color = factor(c("Green","Red","Yellow","Yellow","Yellow","Red","Green","Red","Yellow","Green"))
)
```

#### Taking the mean of each variable

``` r
mean_time = mean(pull(df, time_min))
mean_ontime = mean(pull(df, on_time))
mean_zone = mean(pull(df, zone))
mean_color = mean(pull(df, color))
```

-   The mean of the variable `time_min` is -0.07.
-   The mean of the variable `on_time` is 0.4.
-   The mean of the variable `zone` is NA.
-   The mean of the variable `color` is NA.

Therefore, we know that we can take the means of a numeric vector and a
logical vector, but not of a factor vector or a character vector.

#### Converting variables from one type to another

``` r
as.numeric(df$on_time)
as.numeric(df$zone)
as.numeric(df$color)
```

1.  In R, for a logical vector, `TRUE` is considered as 1 and `FALSE` is
    considered as 0. Hence, we can take a mean value of a logical
    vector. When we convert a logical vector into a numeric vector, it
    will return as ‘1’ or ‘0’ as well.

2.  Because the variable `zone` are made up of alphabet characters, when
    we try to convert it to numeric, it will return `NA`.

3.  The factor vector has been converted to \[1,2,3\] three different
    numeric vectors as originally the factor vector has three levels.
    The default ordering of the factor vector is alphabetical. Those
    with lower alphabetical order will be assigned as ‘1’, and so on.
